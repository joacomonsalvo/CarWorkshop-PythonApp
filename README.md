# CarWorkshop-PythonApp

## Purpose

This repository is focused on creating an application, 100% made with python,
which allows the user to add the information of the customer's vehicle to which
they attend and access it at any time, in addition to a visual interface,
annotations on the changes that exist what to do to the vehicle.

## Languages

The main language of this project is Python, this repository is completely
dedicate to that programming language. That's why, the visual interface of
the app is done with it, regardless of whether it is not the best option for
it.

### Why Python?

Python is the programming language of this project for one main reason, it's
the one i'm learning actually and I wanted to dedicate the full project to it.

## Ideas to be implemented

First of all, when the visual interface in finished, the next step would be to
make a ML or DL model to detect 3d model of cars, and if the data base has not
the 3d model of the car, generate one with some images.
